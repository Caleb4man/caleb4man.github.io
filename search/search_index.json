Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. Casting Time \u00b6 Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast. Bonus Action \u00b6 A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. Reactions \u00b6 Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. Longer Casting Times \u00b6 Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over. Casting Multiple Spells on a Turn \u00b6 When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on your turn in combat, you cannot cast another spell on the same turn unless it is a cantrip. Range \u00b6 The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like magic missile , the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball , the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts. Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you. Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise. Components \u00b6 A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell. Verbal (V) \u00b6 Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component. Somatic (S) \u00b6 Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures. Material (M) \u00b6 Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in \u201cEquipment\u201d) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell. If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components--or to hold a spellcasting focus--but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components. Duration \u00b6 A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. Instantaneous \u00b6 Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant. Concentration \u00b6 Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required). Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration: Casting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once. Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage. Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die. The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell. Targets \u00b6 A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. A Clear Path to the Target \u00b6 To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. Targeting Yourself \u00b6 If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. Areas of Effect Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. Areas of Effect \u00b6 Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin , a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object. A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover. Cone \u00b6 A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length. A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. Cube \u00b6 You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. Cylinder \u00b6 A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect. Line \u00b6 A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. Sphere \u00b6 You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect. Saving Throws \u00b6 Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers. Attack Rolls \u00b6 Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated. The Schools of Magic \u00b6 Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence. Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing. Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds. Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently. Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. Combining Magical Effects \u00b6 The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.","title":"Casting a Spell"},{"location":"Homebrew/Casting%20a%20Spell/#casting-a-spell","text":"When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. Typical Difficulty Classes \u00b6 Task Difficulty DC Very Easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very Hard 25 Nearly Impossible 30 Miraculous 35 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Contests \u00b6 Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Skills \u00b6 Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics , Sleight of Hand , and Stealth , respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution .) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Strength \u00b6 Athletics Dexterity \u00b6 Acrobatics Sleight of Hand Stealth Intelligence \u00b6 Arcana History Investigation Nature Religion Wisdom \u00b6 Animal Handling Insight Medicine Perception Survival Charisma \u00b6 Deception Intimidation Performance Persuasion Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, \u201cMake a Wisdom ( Perception ) check.\u201d At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength ( Athletics ) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics , the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. Expertise \u00b6 Characters can only add their proficiency bonus to a single roll once unless a feature states otherwise. When a feature says a character gains expertise in a skill, tool, or other ability that they could have proficiency in, they have the ability to add their proficiency bonus to the roll twice. Characters should never add their proficiency bonus to a single roll more than twice. Skills with Different Abilities \u00b6 Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics , for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution ( Athletics ) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics , you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ( Athletics ) check. Similarly, when your half\u2011orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength ( Intimidation ) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma . Passive Checks \u00b6 A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check: 8 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score . For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception , he or she has a passive Wisdom ( Perception ) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the \u201c Dexterity \u201d section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. Working Together \u00b6 Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action. A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. Group Checks \u00b6 When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't. To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom ( Survival ) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.","title":"Ability Checks"},{"location":"Homebrew/1-Core%20Rules/5-Ability%20Checks/#ability-checks","text":"An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.

Class Features \u00b6 As a rogue, you gain the following class features.

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's damage type to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't [[Incapacitated]], and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves' Cant \u00b6 During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Canny \u00b6 Starting at 1st level, choose one skill. You gain [[proficiency]] in that skill. If you already have proficiency in that skill, you instead gain [[expertise]] in that skill. You gain this feature multiple times as you level up in this class, as indicated by the Rogue table. Cunning Action \u00b6 Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], or [[Hide]] action. Rogueish Archetype \u00b6 At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate as you exercise your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and again at 11th, 16th, and 21st level. Hunter Feature \u00b6 Uncanny Dodge Extra Attack? Evasion \u00b6 Beginning at 8th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent \u00b6 At 11th level, choose two skills for which you are proficient. Whenever you make an ability check that uses that skill, you can instead choose to forgo rolling the die and take a 10 as though you had rolled it on the die. Fighting Style \u00b6 At 14th level, you can choose a [[Fighting Style]] from the following list: Dueling , [[Archery]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting]], [[Blind Fighting]], [[Thrown Weapon Fighting]], Slippery \u00b6 By 15th level, you have acquired greater strength over your senses. You gain proficiency in [[Consititution]] saving throws, [[Wisdom]] saving throws, or you can add twice your proficiency bonus to [[Dexterity]] saving throws. Elusive \u00b6 Beginning at 18th level, choose one of the following features. Evasive. Attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't [[Incapacitated]]. Hidden. When you hide in combat, choose one creature. You are considered hidden from that creature provided you have at least light obscurement or cover from them and you aren't incapacitated. Stroke of Luck \u00b6 At 25th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Hit Points \u00b6 Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st Proficiencies \u00b6 Armor: [[light armor]], [[medium armor]], [[heavy armor]], [[shields]] Weapons: [[simple weapons]], [[martial weapons]] Tools: none Saving Throws: Strength , Constitution Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics , Animal Handling , Athletics , History , Insight , Intimidation , Perception , and Survival Equipment \u00b6 You start with the following items, plus anything provided by your background. (a) [[chain mail]] or (b) [[leather armor]], [[longbow]], and 20 [[arrow]]s (a) a [[martial weapon]] and a [[shield]] or (b) two [[martial weapon]]s (a) a [[light crossbow]] and 20 [[bolts]] or (b) two [[handaxe]]s (a) a [[dungeoneer's pack]] or (b) an [[explorer's pack]] Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 \u00d7 10 gp to buy your own equipment. Maneuvers \u00b6 Maneuvers are what differentiate a trained fighter from the common warrior. At 1st level, you learn 4 maneuvers, and you learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table. You use maneuvers when you take the attack action, and you cannot use a maneuver when you are using an exploit or a blitz (detailed later in this description). Maneuvers use different amounts of time to use. Many maneuvers take 1 attack, which is a part of the attack action, but can also be used on bonus action attacks. Others take 1 action, and generally detail different circumstances for an attack action therein. This still counts as an attack action. You take an action while using a maneuver unless the maneuver states otherwise. Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) Exploits \u00b6 Exploits are special maneuvers, powered by superiority dice. At 2nd level, you learn 2 exploits, and learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table. You cannot use an Exploit at the same time you use a Maneuver. When an exploit calls for a saving throw to resist the exploit's effects, use your Maneuver saving throw DC. Superiority Dice. You have 1 superiority die, which is a d6. You regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain more superiority dice at different levels, shown in the Fighter table. Blitzes \u00b6 Blitzes represent the ability to pull the pinnacle of combat strength for a moment. At 11th level, you learn 1 blitz, and learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table. You can use each blitz you know once, and you gain the ability to use them again after a long rest. You may choose the same blitz multiple times. If you do so, you can use that blitz up to the number of times that you selected that blitz. You cannot use a Blitz at the same time you use an Exploit or Maneuver. When an blitz calls for a saving throw to resist the blitz's effects, use your Maneuver saving throw DC. Multiclassing \u00b6 Ability Score Minimum: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies. Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons Attacks against many creatures \u00b6 This document includes many situations where you have to make attacks against many creatures. As a result, this can become cumbersome for the party and slow down combat. Instead, consider this alternative rule. It is still under assessment, so no promises about how effective it will be. Consistent attacker. Make one attack roll against all creatures for that maneuver, exploit, or blitz. If you have advantage against half or more of those creatures, you have advantage on the attack roll. If you have disadvantage against one or more of those creatures, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you have advantage against more than half of your targets and disadvantage against at least one, these sources of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. Feats \u00b6 Unlike normal fighters, this fighter does not gain so many Ability Score improvements. This helps alleviate, but does not solve the problem of feats breaking the power curve when they interact with this class. As a result, use caution when allowing feats, and make these changes. - Lucky: You cannot use Lucky while using the optional rule Consistent Attacker. - Fighting Initiate: Because fighting styles no longer exist, this could cause problems with synergies getting out of hand. Consider this optional rule: - When you take Fighting Initiate, you learn one maneuver of your choice from the Fighter class. You must follow all other rules about using maneuvers from the fighter class. From Xanathar's Guide to Everything: - Orcish Fury: Rerolling a damage die counts as an Exploit, and so is incompatible with Maneuvers, other Exploits, and Blitzes. In addition, the following feats from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything need some changes. - Crusher: Moving a creature 5 feet after a hit counts as a maneuver, and so is incompatible with other Maneuvers, Exploits, and Blitzes. - Piercer: Rerolling a damage die after an attack hits counts as a maneuver, and so is incompatible with other Maneuvers, Exploits, and Blitzes. - Slasher: Decreasing a target's speed by 10 feet counts as a maneuver, and so is incompatible with other Maneuvers, Exploits, and Blitzes.","title":"Fighter"},{"location":"Homebrew/3-Classes/1-Fighter/1-Fighter/#fighter","text":"This fighter is designed for a specific type of player who enjoys a more technical style of play.

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic\u2014abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the 1-Fighter 's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook. Spellcasting \u00b6 When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Spell Slots . The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot. Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic. Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Weapon Bond \u00b6 At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two. War Magic \u00b6 Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Eldritch Strike \u00b6 At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn. Arcane Charge \u00b6 At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action. Improved War Magic \u00b6 Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. ##### Eldritch Knight Spellcasting | [[Fighter]] Level | Cantrips Known | Spells Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | |:-:|:-|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |3rd| 2| 3|2|-|-|-| |4th| 2| 4|3|-|-|-| |5th| 2| 4|3|-|-|-| |6th| 2| 4|3|-|-|-| |7th| 2| 5|4|2|-|-| |8th| 2| 6|4|2|-|-| |9th| 2| 6|4|2|-|-| |10th|3| 7|4|3|-|-| |11th|3| 8|4|3|-|-| |12th|3| 8|4|3|-|-| |13th|3| 9|4|3|2|-| |14th|3|10|4|3|2|-| |15th|3|10|4|3|2|-| |16th|3|11|4|3|3|-| |17th|3|11|4|3|3|-| |18th|3|11|4|3|3|-| |19th|3|12|4|3|3|1| |20th|3|13|4|3|3|1|","title":"Eldritch Knight"},{"location":"Homebrew/3-Classes/1-Fighter/Martial%20Archetype/Eldritch%20Knight/#eldritch-knight","text":"The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic\u2014abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the 1-Fighter 's reach in combat.

Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Spell Slots . The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot. Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

Cantrips \u00b6 At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list . You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells \u00b6 The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list . When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots or lower. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability \u00b6 Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting \u00b6 You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus \u00b6 You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain \u00b6 Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells \u00b6 Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list , the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity \u00b6 At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \u00b6 As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Divine Doctrines \u00b6 At 2nd level, you gain two acts of authority, called Divine Doctrines . You gain more Divine Doctrines as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Cleric Table. Ability Score Improvement \u00b6 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Destroy Undead \u00b6 Starting at 6th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. Table- Destroy Undead Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR ... 6th 1/2 or lower 10th 1 or lower 14th 2 or lower 18th 3 or lower 22nd 4 or lower Divine Intervention \u00b6 Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required. Miracle \u00b6 At 13th level, you gain the ability to cast the upper tiers of spells granted to you by your diety. You gain one 6th level spell slot. This spell slot can be used to cast any cleric spell you have prepared. This spell slot returns when you complete a long rest. As you gain more levels, you gain more of these spell slots - a 7th level slot at level 16, an 8th level slot at level 18, and a 9th level slot at level 21.

Regardless of what spell list you choose from, this cantrip counts as a Cleric spell for you. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival. Channel Divinity: Wild Shape \u00b6 Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to take the shape of a beast. As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to transform into a beast of a CR equal to 1/4 your Cleric level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you use another use of your Channel Divinity. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While transformed, you take on the game statistics of the beast, but retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma scores. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies and add those of the beast. If the beast has any additional action economy options, you cannot use them. While transformed, you have the beast's hit points and hit dice. When you return to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of having 0 hit points, any damage above that which brings you to 0 hit points applies to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in Wild Shape and have 5 hit points left, you revert and take 5 damage. As long as you have hit points remaining after this, you are not knocked unconsious. While in Wild Shape, you cannot speak, cast spells, or take actions that require the use of your hands behond what your beast shape can do. While in Wild Shape, you can continue to concentrate on spells that you have already cast or take actions that are a part of a spell that has already been cast. You retain all features from your character sheet if your new form is capable of using them. However, your special senses, such as darkvision, may not be used unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment drops to the ground at your feet, merges into your new form, or is worn by your new form (if appropriate). Your equipment does not change to match the new form, and anything the new form cannot wear must drop to the ground or merge with it. All equipment that merges with the form has no effect until Wild Shape ends. Land's Stride \u00b6 Starting at 7th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Timeless Body \u00b6 At 17th level, the primal magic that empowers you causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body only ages 1 year. In addition, you become immune to poison and poison damage. Beast Spells \u00b6 At 22nd level, you are no longer limited by the shape of a beast.

Hit Points \u00b6 Hit Dice: 1d6 per sorcerer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st Proficiencies \u00b6 Armor: Light armor Weapons: Daggers, darts, light crossbows, slings, and quarterstaffs Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution , Charisma Skills: Choose two from Arcana , Deception , Insight , Intimidation , Persuasion , and Religion Equipment \u00b6 You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: - (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a sling - (a) a quarterstaff or (b) any simple weapon - (a) a dungeoneer\u2019s pack or (b) an explorer\u2019s pack - Two daggers \\page Sorcerous Origin \u00b6 At 1st level, you choose the source of your arcane power from the following options: Wild Magic or Dragonblood, each of which is detailed at the end of this class. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. Origin Spells \u00b6 Each sorcerous origin has a list of origin spells that you gain at the sorcerer levels noted in the origin description. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don't count against your total number of Spells Known. These spells are also considered part of the sorcerer spell list for you. Sorcery \u00b6 See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. Cantrips \u00b6 You know two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list . You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the sorcerer table. Spell Slots \u00b6 The sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \u00b6 At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list . The Spells Known column of the sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new sorcerer spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list , which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability \u00b6 Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus \u00b6 You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. Fonts of Magic \u00b6 At 2nd level, you gain two fonts of magic of your choice. A list of the available options can be found later in this description. When you gain certain sorcerer levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the sorcerer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the fonts you know and replace it with another font that you could learn at that level. If a font has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the font at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \\page Arcane Stability \u00b6 At 3rd level, your magic begins to materialize, giving you a physical manifestation of the force that is within you. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Arcane Blade \u00b6 You can use your action to create a weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. While you hold this weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. Arcane Assistant \u00b6 You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, mephit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own. Arcane Object \u00b6 Your magic materializes as an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your charisma modifier, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest. If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die. Arcane Reference \u00b6 Your magic materializes as a tome called a Book of Mystics. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a sorcerer cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Mystics, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Ability Score Improvement \u00b6 When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Sorcerous Versatility \u00b6 4th-level sorcerer optional feature Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies: Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Sorcery feature with another cantrip from the sorcerer spell list . Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options. If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another sorcerer spell of the same level. If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Fonts of Magic, you must also replace them now, choosing Fonts for which you qualify. Mystic Arcanum \u00b6 At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the sorcerer spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. Magic Incarnate \u00b6 At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power to regain expended spell slots. You can take an action to regain all your expended spell slots from your Sorcery feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. Wild Magic \u00b6 Wild Magic Surge \u00b6 Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. A Wild Magic Surge can happen once per turn. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Tides of Chaos \u00b6 Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature. Controlled Chaos \u00b6 At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number. Spell Bombardment \u00b6 Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn. Dragonblood \u00b6 Dragon Ancestor \u00b6 At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. Draconic Resilience \u00b6 As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Dragon Wings \u00b6 At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. Draconic Presence \u00b6 Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.","title":"Silent Image"},{"location":"Homebrew/9-Spells/Level%201/Sleep/","text":"Sleep \u00b6 1st-level enchantment Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket) Duration: 1 minute This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.

If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is made with thin lines and is nearly invisible. It requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 5d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person , that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball , can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich 's life drain attack. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
