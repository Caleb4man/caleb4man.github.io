# Definitions
## C
C is the total number of claims included in a work

## Ci
Ci is the number of citations in the work

## Sy
Sy is the number of complete syllogisms in the work

## E
E is the total number of enthymemes in the work

## B
B is the total number of baseless statements in the work.

# Formula / Proof

C=(Sy*3)+(E*2)+B

C = Adjectives + Adverbs + Verbs other than "to be" (or periods + Semicolons + Conjunctions?)
Adjective-Noun combinations that are used more than once can be consolidated as a noun phrase to narrow down some additional statements.

However, in the first situation, the Syllogisms and Enthymemes may share premises. Mathematically, it is difficult to automatically determine this number of overlapping premises. However, this can be remedied by hand or by ignoring the problem and hoping it goes away.

C, like a mean, needn't be as small as possible, or as accurate as possible. It simply needs to be as usable as possible.

With C, we can turn our attention on the rest of quantitative rhetoric. The rhetor may turn to the other sections of the work and find the following types of statements: 
- Premises copied from other works. 
- Evidence from their own work. 
- Enthymemes drawn from part of the necessary resources, but not all
- Syllogism conclusions drawn from necessary results of other statements
- Baseless statements that lack evidence entirely

Baseless statements may not be completely bad; they certainly have their place. But the presence of baseless statements and enthymemes can be used as a number accounting for the total number of missing premises, in the following equation, where missing premises is called Mp.

Mp = E+(B*2)

In this format, in order to determine what counts as a baseless statement or enthymeme, the S formula must be applied at a granular level, searching for grammatically independent information.
