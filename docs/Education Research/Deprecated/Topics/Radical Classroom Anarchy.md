As we move further into modern teaching I have noticed a push away from traditional teaching methods.

The latest form of this, I call radical Classroom anarchy.

Have you ever noticed that an office space is starkly different from a home, and different still from an elementary school classroom?

Observation 1: Women and girls are seriously outperforming boys in the classroom.
Observation 2: Male teachers generally keep their classrooms less decorated.
Observation 3: Male students tend to be more easily bored or distracted.
Observation 4: Most teachers seem to be female, especially at young ages.

Are these connected? And in what ways?

The spaces run by men - that is, in offices, on oil rigs, in the military, and in higher education, for now - tend to have decidedly different decoration. They feature functional or minimal decoration, and tend to have clearly defined boundaries for what constitutes an acceptable decoration. If they have decoration at all, these usually have solitary houseplants, pictures in frames, and photos of their loved ones on their desk.

(My mother, of course, is one notable exception to this rule. She, too, is a minimalist, like all the male members of my family.)

A quick google search gives me some interesting information. I searched google images for "Classroom" to get an idea of classrooms in general, and then searched: "United States Classroom", "Canada Classroom", "Japan Classroom", "Finland Classroom", and "Israel Classroom".
Choosing these nations was based on their high educational attainment, their variety of cultures, including one from North America, which will serve as another, similar situation to the United States, one from Asia, one from the Middle East, and one from northern europe.

With the exception of Israel and United States, all these searches yielded classrooms that were generally sparsely decorated. They lacked artwork on the walls, almost nothing was hanging up in the room, and they were nearly devoid of anything that was not directly related to the lesson at hand. In Japan, teachers can do very little to decorate the classroom, because the teachers travel around the school, not the students.

I have noticed, anecdotally, that male teachers have rooms with strictly functional decoration. They will have a poster showing 50 digits of pi, for example, or the abbreviation PEMDAS, or a listing of the planets in the solar system graphically, but probably not a giant picture of the animated characters from UP!, a long poster stating "The only thing you can control is your ATTITUDE", or a poster of... masks? For no aparrent reason? 

And, yes, I am writing this in a classroom with all three of those things on the walls.



Here, I hope to have some research on what is in a classroom.



This complex approach to education does not simply extend to the classroom decorations. The functions of the classroom have gotten more complex, as well. I had a teacher in middle school who frustrated the entire class by forcing us to use "Cornell Notes", as they were called. When you are writing in a small notebook to begin with, and you lack manual dexterity because you are a boy and boys do not develop as strong manual dexterity as early as girls, and a teacher wants to take away a quarter of your page for notes... you get upset and frustrated. We didn't like that teacher. But the girls liked her just fine.
