Accumulate many students.

Divide students into groups of 4, then divide those groups into two cohorts. 

The first cohort will recieve directions set 1. The second cohort will recieve directions set 2. 

Each group will be given the same puzzle. Take apart a small puzzle, then use the pieces of that puzzle to open a small box. However, the small box, despite appearing to be opened by inserting one of the pieces of the small puzzle, can only be opened by using one of the pieces of the puzzle which is magnetized to open the box. As a result, the process to open the box should usually contain at least 3 steps.

1. Solve the puzzle.
2. Attempt to open the box, and fail.
3. Fumble around until the box opens.

Alternatively, the solvers could open the box this way.
1. Solve the puzzle.
2. Attempt to open the box, and fail.
3. Discover that the puzzle pieces are magnetic.
4. Fumble around until the box opens.

The two cohorts will be given two different sets of directions, and a twenty-minute timer. The timer will stop when they successfully open the box.

The first set of directions is as follows. 

Solve the puzzle and open the box.

The second set of directions is as follows.

Solve the puzzle and use it to open the box.

No further directions will be given.
