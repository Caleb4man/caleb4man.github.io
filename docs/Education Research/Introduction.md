Over the past millenium, most philosophical disciplines have grown in leaps and bounds. But Rhetoric has largely sat undeveloped and relegated to the realm of the arts. Yet Rhetoric bears more resemblance to the realms of linguistics or psychology, not of literature or painting.

If we concede that, perhaps, Rhetoric is more akin to an art, we find that it still has been neglected. The visual arts have discovered significant leaps in the availability, reliability, and production of artwork. Where visual art was once the realm of the extremely wealthy, now it is in the hands and on the feet of every man, woman, and child. 

Rhetorical study often falls into two major categories: Quantitative linguistics study and qualitative studies. But while most academic study has become more quantitative in the past hundred years with the advent of computation, rhetoric seems to have been lost behind the curve.

This failure to keep up with the other disciplines can be directly drawn to a lack of measurability in Rhetoric. While rudimentary or robust scales can be found to quantify most important aspects of disciplines, rhetoric lacks any type of measurability. Where physics has time, space, temperature, and charge, and even the visual arts have color and value, rhetoric lacks any major remotely objective measure. 

My purpose is to create a rudimentary scale which can be applied to any work and has little to debate, and can be used as a way to quantify the total amount of rhetorical work being done.
