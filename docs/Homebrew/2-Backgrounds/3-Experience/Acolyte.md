#### Feature: Faithful Resources
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You can cast the spell [[Ceremony]] with this feature. When cast with this feature, you may only cast it as a ritual, and you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again. [[5-Wisdom|Wisdom]] is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

If you cast this spell while in an operating temple of your deity or closely allied deity with available materials, the material components are provided for you free of charge.
