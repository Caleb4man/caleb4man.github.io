### The Great City
This predominantly Human city culture is a melting pot of all of its surrounding cultures. They pride themselves on being a race of everyday heroes.
- ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
- ***Tool Proficiency.*** You are proficient in one type of artisan's tools or thieves' tools.
- ***Prepared.*** Humans are continually innovating and preparing for many types of situations. When you are targeted by an effect that forces you to make a saving throw other than a death saving throw for which you are not proficient, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to that saving throw. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a short or long rest.
