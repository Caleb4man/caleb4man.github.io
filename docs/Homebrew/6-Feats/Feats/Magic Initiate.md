#### Magic Initiate
Choose a spellcasting class. You learn two cantrips of your choice, if available, from that class's spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again using this feat.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells matches that of the class which you chose.
