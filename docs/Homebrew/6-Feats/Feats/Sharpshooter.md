#### Sharpshooter

You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

-   When you make a ranged weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to add 1d10 to the attack or damage roll of that attack. You can add the amount before or after making the attack or damage roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
-   Attacking a prone target or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
-   Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
