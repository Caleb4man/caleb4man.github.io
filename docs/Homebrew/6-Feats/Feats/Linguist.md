#### Linguist
You have studied languages and codes, gaining the following benefits:

-   Increase your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] or [[4-Charisma|Charisma]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
-   You learn three languages of your choice.
-   You can ably create written ciphers. Others canâ€™t decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] check (DC equal to your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it.
