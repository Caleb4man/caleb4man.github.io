#### Great Weapon Master (~)

Youâ€™ve learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. While wielding a weapon with the heavy and two-handed properties you gain the following benefits:

-   Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half the damage of the original attack.
-   When you make a melee attack and reduce a creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit, you can make another attack with the weapon as a bonus action.
