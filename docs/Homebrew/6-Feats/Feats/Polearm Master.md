#### Polearm Master (~)

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, spear, or trident in two hands you gain the following benefits:

-   When you take the Attack action with a polearm you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifer as the primary weapon. The weaponâ€™s damage die for this attack is a d4, and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
-   Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
