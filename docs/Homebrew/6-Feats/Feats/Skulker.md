#### Skulker

_Prerequisite: [[2-Dexterity|Dexterity]] 13 or higher_

---

You are expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on any checks to hide when you are at least heavily obscured, and can attempt to hide if you are only lightly obscured.
-   When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.
-   Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your [[5-Wisdom|Wisdom]] ([[Perception]]) checks relying on sight.
