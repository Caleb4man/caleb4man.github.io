#### Savage Attacker (+)

You are a brutal and terrifying opponent in combat, and gain the following benefits:

-   Increase your [[1-Strength|Strength]] or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
-   When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, the first weapon damage die you would roll is maximized.
-   When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to attempt to frighten another creature within 30 feet of you until the start of your next turn. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
