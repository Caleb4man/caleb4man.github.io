### Creating a character
A character made in this manner takes one selection from each of the following categories: Species, Community, and Experience. 

As one's Experience dictates their specialization, this is where the character's most ability score increases come from.

### Ability Scores: Cards
Make a deck of cards with the following numbers on them: 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9. Shuffle them and divide them into 6 separate piles of 2 cards (Your DM may request that you keep them in order). 

Look at the resulting numbers. You may exchange any one card for any one other card in one other pile. Add together the two numbers that are now in each pile; these are your [[ability scores]].

> ##### Cards vs Rolling for stats
> This deck of cards yields slightly worse results than taking the highest 3 of 4d6.  The average result with this deck is 12, compared to 4d6's 12.24 or 3d6's 10.5. 
> 
> However, it is significantly more consistent. 4d6's standard deviation is 2.85, and 3d6's is 2.96. Cards have a standard deviation of 2.70. In addition, the fact that every character has the same cards keeps the total number of points across all the characters even.

### Choosing your background
When you choose your background, choose one of each of the three categories: Species, Community, and Experience. These represent your physical traits, the community you grew up around, and your trade or prior knowledge.

### Notes
Characters that are Medium size have a base walking speed of 30 feet. Characters that are Small have a base walking speed of 25 feet.

> #### Why are there no exotic race communities?
> Races like Half-elves and Half-orcs do not generally have their own community. Instead, they live in communities that are willing to harbor them, either of their parents' lineages or with another community. 
> 
> Tieflings largely exist within [[human]] settlements, so do not have their own community. Instead, they use a host community, like the half-races.
