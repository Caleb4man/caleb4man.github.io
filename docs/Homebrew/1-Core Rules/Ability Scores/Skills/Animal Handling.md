**Animal Handling.** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animalâ€™s intentions, the GM might call for a [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] (Animal Handling) check. You also make a [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
