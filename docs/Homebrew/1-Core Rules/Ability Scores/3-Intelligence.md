# Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

## Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

An Intelligence check might also reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

**Other Intelligence Checks.** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Estimate the value of a precious item
-   Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
-   Forge a document
-   Recall lore about a craft or trade
-   Win a game of skill

## Skills
When you create your character, you become proficient in a number of skills from your class's skill list equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). If your intelligence increases or decreases to change your intelligence modifier permanently, you gain or lose proficiency in the appropriate number of skills.
