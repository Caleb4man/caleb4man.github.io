## Design Principles

### Time
One of the key notes to keep in mind about 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons is that it expects 6-8 encounters a day, with 1-2 short rests interspersed. Different classes benefit differently in 5e from short or long rests. However, many people do not take their campaigns at this pace, and instead the game suffers from imbalance.

As a result, 5e suffers from people who claim that the monk is severely weak because their ki returns on short rests, or those who claim that warlocks do nothing but spam eldritch blast. 

In this project, I will be attempting to balance for all classes regaining the majority of their strength from short rests, especially casters. Spell slots will be changed accordingly.

Because of the significant change, most classes will now play more like the warlock.

### Optimizing Exploration vs Combat
Many players enjoy optimizing for combat.
That's great. We appreciate that.

However, most players would also like to have an enjoyable time working outside of combat, and each character should have different tools to work with. Each class should feel as though it brings something different to the table.

### Magic and Heroes
All heroes are assumed to be magical. They perform feats of incredible mystery, speed, skill, and power. The way that magic manifests itself in their life is based on what class they play as.

### Tiers of Play
The first tier of play runs from 1-5. At this level, the characters are dealing with local threats and are apprentice-level characters.
The second tier of play runs from 6-12. At this level, the characters are dealing with regional threats, adventuring in properly dangerous areas, and engaging in all the situations that the famous adventurers do not have time for.
The third tier of play runs from 13-20. At this level, the characters are dealing with serious, world-threatening and peacekeeping operations. They are significant players on the world stage, and can tip the scales of power one way or another.
The fourth tier of play runs from 21-25. At this level, characters are threatened only by large armies, divine intervention, and otherworldly beings.
