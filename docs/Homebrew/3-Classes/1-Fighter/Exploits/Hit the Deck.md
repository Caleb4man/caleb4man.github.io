#### Hit the Deck
*Fighter Exploit*
___
- **Time:** 1 Reaction, which you take when you are targeted by an effect that requires you to make a saving throw.
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you are targeted with an effect that requires you to make a saving throw, roll your superiority die. You can then move up to that number * 5 feet as a reaction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. 
When you end this movement, you are knocked prone, and if you moved at least 10 feet, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If this movement took you outside of the area of effect, you have advantage on the saving throw against the effect.
