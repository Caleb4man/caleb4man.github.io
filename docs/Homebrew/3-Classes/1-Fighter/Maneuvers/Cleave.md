#### Cleave
*Fighter Maneuver*
___
- **Time:** 1 attack
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Prerequisite:** A melee weapon that deals slashing damage

When you make a melee attack with a weapon that deals slashing damage with this maneuver, if you deal more damage than the target has remaining hit points and another target is within range and within 5 feet of the first target and the original attack roll would hit the second creature, the second creature takes the remaining damage + your strength modifier. If you do not reduce the target to 0 hit points, the second target takes damage equal to your strength modifier.
