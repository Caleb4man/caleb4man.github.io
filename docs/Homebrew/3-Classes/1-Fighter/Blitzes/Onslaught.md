#### Onslaught
*Fighter Blitz*
___
- **Time:** 1 action
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You flourish your weapon and then dash to strike like the wind. Make five attacks. After each attack, you can move up to half your speed before making the next attack. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and does not count against your movement for the round. Each attack deals an additional 4d10 damage of the weapon's type.
