## Class Features
As a fighter, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per fighter level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your [[1-Constitution|Constitution]] modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your [[1-Constitution|Constitution]] modifier per fighter level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** [[light armor]], [[medium armor]], [[heavy armor]], [[shields]]
- **Weapons:** [[simple weapons]], [[martial weapons]]
- **Tools:** none

___
- **Saving Throws:** [[1-Constitution|Constitution]], [[2-Dexterity|Dexterity]]
- **Skills:** Choose from [[Acrobatics]], [[Animal Handling]], [[Athletics]], [[History]], [[Insight]], [[Intimidation]], [[Perception]], and [[Survival]]

#### Equipment
You start with the following items, plus anything provided by your background.

- *(a)* [[chain mail]] or *(b)* [[leather armor]], [[longbow]], and 20 [[arrow]]s
- *(a)* a [[martial weapon]] and a [[shield]] or *(b)* two [[martial weapon]]s
- *(a)* a [[light crossbow]] and 20 [[bolts]] or *(b)* two [[handaxe]]s
- *(a)* a [[dungeoneer's pack]] or *(b)* an [[explorer's pack]]

Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your own equipment.

### [[Maneuvers]]
[[Maneuvers]] are what differentiate a trained fighter from the common warrior. At 1st level, you learn 2 [[maneuvers]], and you learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table.
You use [[maneuvers]] when you take the attack action, and you cannot use a maneuver when you are using an exploit or a blitz (detailed later in this description).

[[Maneuvers]] use different amounts of time to use. Many [[maneuvers]] take 1 attack, which is a part of the attack action, but can also be used on bonus action attacks. Others take 1 action, and generally detail different circumstances for an attack action therein. This still counts as an attack action. You take an action while using a maneuver unless the maneuver states otherwise.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your [[maneuvers]] require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your [[1-Constitution|Constitution]] or [[2-Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier (your choice)

### Jack of All Trades
When you make an ability check or attack roll where you do not add your proficiency bonus, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to that roll.

### [[Exploits]]
[[Exploits]] are special [[maneuvers]], powered by superiority dice. At 2nd level, you learn 2 [[exploits]], and learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table.
You cannot use an Exploit at the same time you use a Maneuver.

When an exploit calls for a saving throw to resist the exploit's effects, use your Maneuver saving throw DC.

***Superiority Dice.*** You have 1 superiority die, which is a d6. You regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain more superiority dice at different levels, shown in the Fighter table.


### [[Blitzes]]
[[Blitzes]] represent the ability to pull the pinnacle of combat [[1-Strength|strength]] for a moment. 

At 11th level, you learn 1 blitz, and learn more as you gain levels, as shown in the Fighter table. You can use each blitz you know once, and you gain the ability to use them again after a long rest. You may choose the same blitz multiple times. If you do so, you can use that blitz up to the number of times that you selected that blitz.

You cannot use a Blitz at the same time you use an Exploit or Maneuver.
When an blitz calls for a saving throw to resist the blitz's effects, use your Maneuver saving throw DC.
