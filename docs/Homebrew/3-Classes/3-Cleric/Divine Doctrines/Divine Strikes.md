### Divine Strikes
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to mark the target of the attack. The next attack made against the marked creature before your next turn is made at advantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
