### Planar Defender
#choicefeature/divinedoctrine
***Prerequisite: 14th level [[Cleric]]***
Your weapon attacks deal 1d8 additional force damage to celestials, fey, fiends, or undead. 

When you use the attack action on your turn to hit a celestial, fey, fiend, or undead, you can expend a spell slot to attempt to turn the creature. That creature must make a [[4-Charisma|Charisma]] saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

**Arcana.** Y[[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]]ce]] (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
