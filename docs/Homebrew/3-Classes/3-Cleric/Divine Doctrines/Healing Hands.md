When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, you can add the creature's [[1-Constitution|constitution]] modifier to the hit points restored. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
