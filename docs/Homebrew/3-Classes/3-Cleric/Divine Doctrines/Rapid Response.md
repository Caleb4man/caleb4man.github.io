### Rapid Response
#choicefeature/divinedoctrine
When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward that creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[5-Wisdom|Wisdom]] modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
