### Healing Force
When you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, you can use your bonus action to restore hit points equal to your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier to one creature within 5 feet of the target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[3-Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.
