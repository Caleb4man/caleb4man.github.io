When you make a successful [[4-Intelligence|Intelligence]] (Medicine) check to stabilize a creature, you can choose to instead restore 1 hit point to the creature. In addition, if you spend 1 hour caring for up to 5 other creatures' wounds, those creatures regain hit points equal to your [[Cleric]] level.
