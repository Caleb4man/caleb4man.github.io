#### Acolyte of Nature

At 1st level, you learn one additional cantrip of your choice from any spell list. Regardless of what spell list you choose from, this cantrip counts as a [[Cleric]] spell for you. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

#### Channel Divinity: Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to take the shape of a beast.

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to transform into a beast of a CR equal to 1/4 your [[Cleric]] level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you use another use of your Channel Divinity. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

- While transformed, you take on the game statistics of the beast, but retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies and add those of the beast. If the beast has any additional action economy options, you cannot use them. 
- While transformed, you have the beast's hit points and hit dice. When you return to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of having 0 hit points, any damage above that which brings you to 0 hit points applies to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in Wild Shape and have 5 hit points left, you revert and take 5 damage. As long as you have hit points remaining after this, you are not knocked unconsious.
- While in Wild Shape, you cannot speak, cast spells, or take actions that require the use of your hands behond what your beast shape can do. While in Wild Shape, you can continue to concentrate on spells that you have already cast or take actions that are a part of a spell that has already been cast. 
- You retain all features from your character sheet if your new form is capable of using them. However, your special senses, such as darkvision, may not be used unless your new form also has that sense. 
- You choose whether your equipment drops to the ground at your feet, merges into your new form, or is worn by your new form (if appropriate). Your equipment does not change to match the new form, and anything the new form cannot wear must drop to the ground or merge with it. All equipment that merges with the form has no effect until Wild Shape ends.

#### Land's Stride
Starting at 7th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

#### Timeless Body
At 17th level, the primal magic that empowers you causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body only ages 1 year. In addition, you become immune to poison and poison damage.

#### Beast Spells
At 22nd level, you are no longer limited by the shape of a beast. You can provide the somatic and verbal components of spells while in Wild Shape, but you cannot provide material components.
