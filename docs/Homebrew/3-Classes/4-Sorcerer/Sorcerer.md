### Sorcerous Origin
At 1st level, you choose the source of your arcane power from the following options: Wild Magic or Dragonblood, each of which is detailed at the end of this class.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

#### Origin Spells
Each sorcerous origin has a list of origin spells that you gain at the sorcerer levels noted in the origin description. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, but they don't count against your total number of Spells Known. These spells are also considered part of the [[sorcerer spell list]] for you.

### Sorcery
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [[sorcerer spell list]]. You learn additional [[sorcerer cantrips]] of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the sorcerer table.

#### Spell Slots
The sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[sorcerer spell list]].

The Spells Known column of the sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new sorcerer spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[sorcerer spell list]], which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
[[6-Charisma|Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, so you use your [[6-Charisma|Charisma]] whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your [[6-Charisma|Charisma]] modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.


**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your [[6-Charisma|Charisma]] modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your [[6-Charisma|Charisma]] modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

### Fonts of Magic
At 2nd level, you gain two fonts of magic of your choice. A list of the available options can be found later in this description. When you gain certain sorcerer levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the sorcerer table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the fonts you know and replace it with another font that you could learn at that level.

If a font has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the font at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

### Arcane Stability
At 3rd level, your magic begins to materialize, giving you a physical manifestation of the force that is within you. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

#### Arcane Blade
You can use your action to create a weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

While you hold this weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

#### Arcane Assistant
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, mephit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.

#### Arcane Object
Your magic materializes as an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your [[6-Charisma|charisma]] modifier, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

#### Arcane Reference
Your magic materializes as a tome called a Book of Mystics. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a sorcerer cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Mystics, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two [[ability scores]] of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Sorcerous Versatility
4th-level sorcerer optional feature

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Sorcery feature with another cantrip from the [[sorcerer spell list]].
Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.
If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another sorcerer spell of the same level.
If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Fonts of Magic, you must also replace them now, choosing Fonts for which you qualify.

### Mystic Arcanum
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the [[sorcerer spell list]] as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

### Magic Incarnate
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power to regain expended spell slots. You can take an action to regain all your expended spell slots from your Sorcery feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Wild Magic
### Wild Magic Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. A Wild Magic Surge can happen once per turn.

If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.


### Tides of Chaos
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

### Controlled Chaos
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

### Spell Bombardment
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

## Dragonblood
### Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your [[2-Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier.

### Dragon Wings
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

### Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
