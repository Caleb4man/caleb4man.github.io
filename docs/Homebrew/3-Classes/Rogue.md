# Rogue
This is where a vignette would go if this was a class in the PHB. However, I don't have the skills required to write a vignette for this. So instead, you are getting a bunch of filler content instead, just large enough to make the design space work nicely.

<!--</div>-->

### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't [[Incapacitated]], and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Thieves' Cant

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Canny
At 2nd level, choose one of your skill proficiencies. If you do not already have expertise in that skill, you gain expertise in that skill.
At 7th level, you can choose two more of your skill proficiencies to gain expertise in.

### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], or [[Hide]] action.

### Rogueish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate as you exercise your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and again at 11th, 16th, and 21st level.

### Hunter Feature
Uncanny Dodge

### Evasion
Beginning at 8th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an [[Ice Storm]] spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
At 11th level, choose two skills for which you are proficient. Whenever you make an ability check that uses that skill, you can instead choose to forgo rolling the die and take a 10 as though you had rolled it on the die.

### Fighting Style
At 14th level, you can choose a [[Fighting Style]] from the following list: [[Dueling]], [[Archery]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting]], [[Blind Fighting]], [[Thrown Weapon Fighting]], [[]]

### Slippery
By 15th level, you have acquired greater strength over your senses. You gain proficiency in [[Consititution]] saving throws, [[Wisdom]] saving throws, or you can add twice your proficiency bonus to [[Dexterity]] saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, choose one of the following features. 

Evasive. Attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't [[Incapacitated]].
Hidden. When you hide in combat, choose one creature. You are considered hidden from that creature provided you have at least light obscurement or cover from them and you aren't incapacitated.


### Stroke of Luck
At 25th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
