#### Mounted Combatant

You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
-   You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
-   When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature while mounted, you and your mount don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn.
-   If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
