___

- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—without falling in and without difficulty unless the surface of the liquid would otherwise be difficult terrain (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

Classes: [[Cleric]]
