You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. They appear as tiny celestials, fey, or fiends (your choice)

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a [[5-Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
