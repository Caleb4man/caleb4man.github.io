You call forth spirits of the dead, which form a shroud around you in a 10-foot radius, 10-foot high cylinder for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and this shroud moves with you as you move.

Creatures inside the shroud are heavily obscured from creatures outside the shroud. Creatures outside the shroud are heavily obscured from creatures inside the shroud.

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d4 extra damage when you hit a creature within the shroud. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold (your choice when you cast the spell). 

- Any creature that takes radiant damage from this spell can't have advantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.
- Any creature that takes necrotic damage from this spell can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.
- Any creature that takes cold damage from this spell has their speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
