This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.


***Stone.*** All weapons made from stone deal bludgeoning damage, even if it would normally deal another type. All weapons and armor made with stone have the *heavy* property, lose *finesse* and *light* properties if they have them, weigh 4 times as much as usual, and cost twice as much, if requested from a normal blacksmith.
