You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, this spell lasts 1 additional hour for each slot level above 2nd.
