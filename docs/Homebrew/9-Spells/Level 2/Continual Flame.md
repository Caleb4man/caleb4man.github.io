---
A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can place one additional flame on the object at another point of your choice for each level above 2nd.
