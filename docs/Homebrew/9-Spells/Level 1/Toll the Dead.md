You point at one creature you can see within range, and it hears the sound of a dolorous bell for a moment. The target must succeed on a [[6-Charisma|Charisma]] saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d10 necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d10), 11th level (3d8 or 3d10), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d10).
