#### Dark Net
*Necromancy Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a net worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:**  Until the target is freed from the net used in the spell's casting
___
You brandish the net used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and the first time it is hit by an attack each round, it takes an extra necrotic damage equal to your spellcasting modifier as shadowy tentacles sprout from the net and leach the life away from its body.

**At Higher Levels.** At 5th level, the necrotic damage increases to 1d6 + your spellcasting modifier. That damage roll increases by 1d6 at 11th level (2d6) and 17th level (3d6).
