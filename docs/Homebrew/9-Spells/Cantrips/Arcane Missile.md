A beam of hardened force jolts toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 6th level, three beams at 12th level, and four beams at 20th level. You can direct the beams at one or more targets. Make a separate attack and damage roll for each beam.
