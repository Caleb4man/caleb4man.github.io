You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and if your current Hit Points are less than than your level, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Moreover, your weapon shines and sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** At 5th level, the extra radiant damage increases by 1d8 and again at 11th level (3d8) and 17th level (4d8).
