*Necromancy Cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a melee weapon that deals slashing damage, worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___
You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and if your current Hit Points are lower than half your Maximum Hit Points, the creature takes an extra 1d6 acid damage as a black and corrosive liquid covers your weapon.

**At Higher Levels.** At 6th level, the extra acid damage increases to 2d6. This damage increases again by 1d6 at 12th level (3d6) and 20th level (4d6).
