#### Guiding Strike
*Divination cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and motes of divine energy appear and float around it until the beginning of your next turn.

If the target of your attack is hit by another weapon attack during the spells duration, the target takes 1d4 radiant damage and the spell ends. 

This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 6th level, the melee attack and the additional damage for being hit by another attack deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to the target. Both damage rolls increase by 1d4 at 12th level and 20th level.
