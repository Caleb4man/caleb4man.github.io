___
A fine layer of ice covers your weapon as you brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** At 5th level, the attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target on a hit. That damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and 17th level (3d8).
