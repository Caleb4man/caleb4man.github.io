You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. Moreover, if the creature is concentrating on a spell at the end of its next turn, it takes another 2d6 psychic damage.
 
**At Higher Levels.** At 6th level, the weapon attack extra psychic damage increases to 2d6, and the psychic damage the target takes if it is concentrating increases to 3d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 12th level (3d6 and 4d6) and 20th level (4d6 and 5d6).
