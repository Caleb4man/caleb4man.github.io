You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make an attack with it against a creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and takes an extra 1d8 poison damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.
 
**At Higher Levels.** At 5th level, the weapon attack extra poison damage increases to 2d8, and if the target fails its saving throw it takes another 1d8 poison damage. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (3d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (4d8 and 3d8).
