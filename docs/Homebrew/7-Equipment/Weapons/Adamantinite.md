***Adamantite.*** This material has all properties of adamantine, but also temporarily absorbs poison into itself. When you apply an injury poison to an adamantite weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison isn't removed after the first injury, but is instead applied every time you deal piercing or slashing damage to a creature until the poison dries naturally. When exposed to sunlight, adamantite weapons disintegrate.
