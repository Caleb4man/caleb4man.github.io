***Mithral.*** A light, flexible material, mithral armor removes Strength requirements and disadvantage on Stealth checks inflicted by wearing certain armor.
Weapons made from mithral are similarly light, weighing half as much as their iron counterparts. Mithral weapons with the *Heavy* property can be used to make extra attacks regardless of the user's strength and can be wielded normally by small creatures.
