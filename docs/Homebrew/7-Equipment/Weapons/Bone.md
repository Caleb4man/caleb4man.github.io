***Bone.*** A strong, off-white material scavenged from animal, monster, or humanoid corpses which is carved or cut into useful shape. Used in areas without access to wood or metal, items made of this inflexible material are as durable as their standard versions, but weigh half as much and have triple the cost. Wearing armor made from bone (an incredibly rare item thanks to bones' inflexibility and inconsistent quality) grants you advantage on saving throws against necromancy spells, and when you cast a necromancy spell through a focus made from bone you can reroll one of the spell's damage dice.
