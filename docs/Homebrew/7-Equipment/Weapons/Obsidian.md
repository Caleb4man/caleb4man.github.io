***Obsidian.*** A precious volcanic glass, weapons made with this delicate material are incredibly sharp. In addition to its typical properties, an obsidian weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage gains the corresponding *status* property if it didn't have it already, and inflicts a status effect when it exceeds the target's AC by 3 or more, rather than 5. Weapons made from obsidian cost four times as much as their mundane counterparts.
