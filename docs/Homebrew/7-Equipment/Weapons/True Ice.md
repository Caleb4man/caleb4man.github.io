***True Ice.*** An exceptional magical material, True Ice comes from the core of polar caps and mountain peaks, and never melts. Elementals aligned with fire or water are vulnerable to damage from true ice weapons. Armor made from True Ice grants resistance to fire damage and immunity to atmospheric hazards in hot environments, but gives disadvantage on saves to avoid cold damage.
