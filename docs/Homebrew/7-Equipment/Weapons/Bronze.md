***Bronze.*** A gold-colored alloy of copper and tin. Though replaced by iron and steel, bronze weapons are known for their magical affinity. When you create a magical weapon, armor, or piece of ammunition with bronze, it takes half the time and price.  Bronze weapons cost 50% more than their iron counterparts, but are produced and sold by few smiths. Most bronze weapons are antiques, though the use of bronze-cast cannon and bombards has caused it to return.
