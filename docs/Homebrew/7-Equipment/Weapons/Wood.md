***Wood.*** Softer and more flexible than most materials, wood is used to make most ranged weapons and some ammunition and does not alter the statistics of those weapons. A wooden weapon or piece of ammunition has the *blunted* modification if it is not made from wood by default, and costs half as much. If the weapon's default material is wood, it works as normal, and uses its listed cost.
