***Steel.*** The best mundane metal that can be made by a typical weaponsmith. It has no magical properties, but its nature allows smiths to select for sharpness, flexibility, hardness, and durability. Its relative resistance to wear and ease of maintenance has made it a material of choice across the world. Steel weapons cannot be damaged by monster features that corrode, damage, or dissolve metal, such as black puddings' *corrosive form*, and cost 50% more than their iron counterparts. Weapons made from steel by default are listed with their cost when made of steel.
