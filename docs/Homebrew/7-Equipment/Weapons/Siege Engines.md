## Siege Engines  
The mightiest mundane items, siege engines are expensive, slow artillery used in large battles. Their might allows settlements without magic or heroes to defend themselves against supernatural threats. Each requires a certain number of actions to load, aim, and attack (in that order), and can be operated by either a crew or a single creature across multiple turns. A crew must have appropriate ammunition, as detailed later in this section, to fire a siege engine.

As objects, each engine is immune to psychic and poison damage. The table below details their statistics. Each adds the listed bonus to its attack and damage rolls, and all save the cauldron, hwacha, and organ gun deal doubled damage to objects and structures. A siege engine's damage changes based on the ammunition loaded into it. When targeting a creature, damage from a siege engine is for considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage so long as the engine's target is one size larger than it or smaller.

***Ballista.*** A torsion-spring-based siege weapon used by the Romans that fires an oversized bolt or sizable stone over impressive range. Resembles a crossbow in apperance, but not mechanical design.

***Cannon.*** Gunpowder artillery made from bronze or iron that fired large balls at enemy fortifications. The cannons in this document are muzzle-loaded, lack wheels, and have the *gunpowder* property.

***Cauldron.*** Filled with liquid and suspended above a gate, wall, or portcullis, creatures in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the cauldron to the ground must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw.

***Hwacha.*** A large handcart loaded with 100 firework-propelled arrows used extensively in Korea against invaders. Angled and ignited to fire hundreds of light projectiles in a shower of flame, it attacks all creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered at a point within range chosen by the crew. The attack also ignites flammable objects within its area of effect that aren't being worn or carried.

***Organ Gun.*** A set of fanned barrels used as an anti-personnel weapon during the Hundred Years' War. An organ gun's massive spread allows targets to escape its grasp; it has disadvantage on all attacks. An organ gun expends 10 bullets for every attack it makes, and does 2d8 piercing damage to each target it hits.

***Ram.***
This movable galley is equipped with an iron-clad log suspended by chains. It requires 6 medium creatures to operate, which have total cover against attacks from above. When it attacks a door or wall, it has advantage on the roll, and deals 3d10+6 bludgeoning damage to that structure.  

***Siege Tower.*** A siege tower is a mobile wooden structure with a beam frame and slats in its walls. Large wheels or rollers allow the tower to be pushed or pulled by 8 medium creatures or 4 large ones . Medium or smaller creatures can use the siege tower to reach the top of walls up to 40 feet high. A creature in the tower has total cover from attacks outside the tower.

***Trebuchet.*** These siege engines hurl their payloads in high arcs that hit targets behind all but total cover, and can arc over walls. The creature which aims the trebuchet chooses a point in range at least 60 feet away. All creatures within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or takes 8d10 bludgeoning damage. Objects in that area also take damage. In addition to heavy stones, trebuchets can fire a variety of other items, which change the amount and type of damage that it deals.

***Xun Lei Chong.*** A single-man siege weapon made from five gun barrels mounted on a single axis, that uses a rotating fuse mechanism to fire multiple shots at one target. A xun lei chong does 10d8 piercing damage on a hit, and expends 5 bullets for every attack it makes. This weapon has the *gunpowder* property, and its user is both prone and gains half cover when using it.

#### Cauldron Contents
You can fill a cauldron with more than boiling water. The table below lists several alternate options, as well as water. A cauldron is assumed to contain 20 gallons of liquid, or the volume of 160 standard flasks.

|     Name      |  Damage   |  Cost  |     |          |
|:-------------:|:---------:|:------:|:---:| -------- |
|     Acid      | 4d6 acid  | 500 gp |     |          |
|  Boiling Fat  | 4d6 fire  |  1 gp  |     |          |
|  Holy Water   | 3d6 fire  | 500 gp |     |          |
|     Lava      | 10d8 fire |   —    |  —  | Cauldron |
|  Boiling Oil  | 5d6 fire  | 32 gp  |     |          |
| Boiling Pitch | 6d6 fire  |  5 gp  |     |          |
| Boiling Water | 3d6 fire  |   —    |  —  |          |

***Boiling Oil.*** When a creature fails its saving throw against the cauldron, it is coated in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 10 fire damage from the burning oil. A 5-foot-radius circle directly below the cauldron is also covered in oil. If lit, the oil burns for 4 rounds and deals 10 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Holy Water.*** Fiends and undead take an additional 4d6 radiant damage from a cauldron of holy water on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a success.

***Magma.*** Only the strongest magical cauldrons can withstand the heat of boiling magma, but it can be a potent siege weapon in battles with magically-gifted combatants.

***Boiling Pitch.*** When a creature fails its save against the cauldron, it is covered in sticky goo. The target's speed is halved until it takes 10 minutes to scrape the tar from its body. If it hasn't removed the tar after 1 hour passes, the tar hardens, and it is restrained until another creature removes the material.

#### Trebuchet Ammunition
Trebuchets can be loaded with a variety of other projectiles with different damage and areas of effect.

|        Name        |      Damage      |   Cost   | Weight |         |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:------:| ------- |

|   Barrel, Sewage   | 5d10 bludgeoning |   4 gp   | 80 lb. |         |
|      Boulder       | 8d10 bludgeoning |   1 gp   | 20 lb. | –       |

|       Corpse       |      varies      |    –     | Varies |         |

***Barrel of Alchemist's Fire.*** After the initial impact, alchemist's fire explodes in all directions. Every creature within 30 feet of the point where the barrel landed must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 8d4 fire damage, or half as much on a success. On a failed save, a creature or flammable object is set alight and takes 3d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check, which extinguishes the flames.  

***Barrel of Sewage.*** After the initial impact, sewage seeps from the barrel in all directions. Every creature within 30 feet of the point where the barrel landed must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against disease or take 2d10 poison damage and contract sewer plague (DMG page 256). On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much poison damage and does not contract the disease.

***Bombs.*** A trebuchet can fire up to 10 bombs of any type at once, which explode on impact.  Each individual bomb forces its saving throw in its radius, against its effects.

***Corpse.*** A corpse targets a space the same size as the creature it was in life (a 5 ft. square for a medium creature, 10 ft. for large, etc). The corpse of a Small creature deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage and 1d10 poison damage. The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10 for every size above Small. Most trebuchets cannot fire Gargantuan creatures.
