## Weapons
### Weapon Properties
#### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the *ammunition* property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition.

Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack you make with this weapon (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

#### Bypass
These flexible weapons  wrap around shields and other personal defenses. When you attack with a bypass weapon, you ignore the AC bonus granted by shields and features that parry or deflect attacks, including the [[Shield(Spell)]] spell.

#### Cavalry
These weapons are well-suited to combat on the move. If you damage a creature with a cavalry weapon after moving at least 30 feet straight toward a target while mounted, you deal an extra 1d6 damage.

#### Ensnaring
These weapons feature chains, hooks, or other parts that entangle. When you hit with an ensnaring weapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone, disarm it, or pull it into a space within 5 feet of you. You can use your weapon attack bonus instead of your Strength (Athletics) bonus when you attempt this action.

When you attempt to disarm a creature using a weapon with the *ensnaring* property, you do not have disadvantage on the roll if the target is larger than you.

#### Finesse
These precise weapons lend themselves to dextrous combat. When you attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Finisher
Finisher weapons are well-suited to executing enemies at your mercy. When you damage a prone creature with a finisher weapon, you roll an additional weapon damage die.

#### Gunpowder
These weapons utilize volatile powder as a propellant to fire projectiles or explode. They cannot be used underwater, and ammunition from these weapons cannot be reused. When you make an attack, the weapon flashes, expels smoke, and creates a bang that can be heard within 300 feet. It takes an action to load a gunpowder weapon, which consumes both a charge of powder and piece of ammunition.

Carrying or storing too much powder is risky. When an item with the *gunpowder* property takes fire or lightning damage, it explodes. The blast forces all creatures and objects within 20 feet to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. A creature wearing, carrying, or wielding an exploding item automatically fails this saving throw.

#### Heavy
These weapons are unwieldier than most. Unless a creature has a Strength score of 12 or higher, it has disadvantage on attacks made with *heavy* weapons. A Small or smaller creature always suffers this disadvantage.

When you attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient in, you can forego adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add that proficiency bonus to the damage roll. You must decide to do this before making the attack roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with the Great Weapon Master feat.

#### Light
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use in an off-hand or fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting part IV.  <!--Once per turn when you attack with a weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can make an additional attack using a weapon with the *light* property that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.-->

#### Loading
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you fire only one piece of ammunition  when you attack with it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Nonlethal
The weapon is designed to incapacitate or is otherwise capable of delivering a hit that does not kill the target. When you choose to knock a creature out instead of killing it, nonlethal weapons deal their normal damage.

#### Parry
If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are wielding a weapon with the *parry* property that you are proficient with, you can use your reaction to add half your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing it to miss. If you do so while wielding two parrying weapons, you add your entire proficiency bonus instead.

#### Prone Fighting
When you are prone and make a weapon attack with this weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.  

#### Ranged
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the *ammunition* or *thrown* property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Some ranged weapons have a Strength requirement listed. You cannot make ranged attack rolls with that ranged weapon if your Strength is lower than that value.

#### Reach
This weapon's extended length adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks. Reach weapons cannot be used for two-weapon fighting regardless of strength or feats.

#### Special
Special weapons have entirely unique attributes, detailed after the weapon charts.

#### Status
Status weapons inflict extra effects on powerful hits. When an attack roll with a status weapon exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more, it inflicts an additional status effect based upon the type of damage dealt. A critical hit also triggers status. If you inflict status on an attack but deal no bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing to a creature with the attack, you do not trigger the effects of status.

**Slashing** weapons inflict gaping wounds and cause profuse bleeding, inflicting additional necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Objects, Constructs, and Elementals and other creatures that do not bleed may be immune to this damage,  at the discretion of your DM.

**Bludgeoning** weapons hit with staggering blows that daze the target. Inflicting this status prevents the targeted creature from taking reactions and reduces its passive Perception by 5 until the start of its next turn.  

**Piercing** weapons reward precise or focused attacks, punching holes in enemy defenses. When you inflict this status, the next attack made against the target gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus.

Improvised weapons may inflict status depending on their damage type and the discretion of your DM.

> Typically, you cannot add your proficiency bonus to any die roll more than once. However, if effects such as *status: piercing* allow you to add your proficiency bonus to an attack or damage roll multiple times (once from your attack roll and once from piercing status that you inflicted on a previous attack), you can do so.

#### Sundering
Sundering weapons crush, break, or penetrate armor. When you attack an object or a target wearing a breastplate, brigandine, cuirass, half plate, hauberk, splint, or full plate with a sundering weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll. You also gain this bonus against creatures with thick shells, metallic hides, and other creatures at the discretion of your DM. Weapons with this property ignore the damage reduction provided by certain kinds of armor.  

#### Sweeping
These weapons strike in broad motions. When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with a sweeping weapon, you can target another creature within 5 feet of the first that you can reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, apply any remaining damage to it. If that creature is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to kill an enemy.

#### Thrown
If a weapon has the *thrown* property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for attack and damage rolls that you would use for a melee attack with it. The standard and maximum ranges of a weapon with the *thrown* property increases by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Strength modifier, unless your Strength modifier is negative.

#### Two-Handed
The weapon is large or cumbersome, and must be wielded in two hands to attack with it. If one of your hands is occupied by performing somatic components, grappling, etc, you cannot attack with this weapon until you return your hand to the weapon. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

#### Versatile
The weapon can be wielded in either one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property, indicating the damage dealt when you use it with two hands.

#### Wind-up
When prepared for the right moment, the weapon can be devastatingly effective. In place of a weapon attack, you can wind up your weapon or brace it against the ground, depending on the weapon's design. The next time you hit with the wound-up weapon before the start of your next turn, you can roll three additional damage dice. A wound-up melee weapon can be used to make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see enters your reach.

### Weapon Charts
The following section lists new and existing weapons, with properties added. Some weapons list multiple damage types. When attacking with one of those weapons, you indicate which damage type you use before you make the attack roll.

### Special Weapons
***Atlatl.*** The atlatl benefits from skill with both ranged and thrown weapons. You can use your Strength modifier to increase the range of darts hurled with this weapon, as though it had the *thrown* property, and it and its darts are considered *thrown* weapons when used to make ranged attacks for the purposes of benefits such as the *Thrown Weapon Fighting* fighting style.

***Arming Sword.*** The techniques of an arming sword are fairly basic, easy to learn, and highly defensive. As a result, you can safely focus on offense and deal more devastating attacks. You can inflict *status* with this weapon, and when you do you inflict the effects of both *status: piercing* and *status: slashing*, regardless of the damage type you dealt.

***Boomerang.*** This weapon returns to your hand if you miss.

***Blowgun.*** If you are hidden when you attack with this weapon, you do not reveal your location.

***Blowgun Needle.*** These minute needles are small enough that when you apply a poison to them, a dose covers 10 pieces of ammunition instead of the usual 3.

***Cestus.*** Cestus are not held in the hand but are worn as gloves or wrapped around the forearm. If you are wielding a cestus, you can use that hand to grapple or shove an enemy, but you cannot make attacks with that hand without ending the grapple. You cannot wield other weapons or shields in that hand, nor can it perform somatic components. Because of its small size and attachment to your hand, you cannot drop a cestus or be disarmed of one unless you are incapacitated. You must use an action to don or doff a cestus, but can don or doff a pair of cestus in one action.

***Chain Whip.*** A length of chain is unbalanced and difficult to use, but can be a far-reaching weapon. When held in both hands, this weapon gains the *reach* property.

***Dueling Shield.*** These large shields have a large triangular boss and hooks and blades built into the rim. A dueling shield adds a +2 bonus to AC when wielded in one hand, as normal. When wielded in both hands, it acts as a melee weapon that deals 1d8 piercing damage with the *ensnaring, heavy,* and *parry* properties in addition to its AC bonus.

***Elemental Ammunition.*** Elemental ammunition includes enchanted bullets, quarrels, needles, or arrows charged with magic. You cannot buy elemental ammunition, but you can craft it if you have proficiency in the appropriate tools and the Arcana skill, and can cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage without expending a spell slot. The ammunition deals that damage instead of its normal type, and returns to normal after one use.

***Firecage Arrow.*** The curved metal bars that flare out from the shaft of this arrow create a cage that carries a burning coal through the air, which sheds dim light in a 5 ft. radius. When you hit with a firecage arrow, half the damage you deal is fire damage, instead of piercing. If you miss with a firecage arrow, choose a space within 15 feet of the target. The arrow ignites objects in that space that aren't being worn or carried.

***Garotte Wire.*** A garrote cannot be used on any creature more than 1 size larger than you, and you can only attack with a garotte if you have advantage. On a hit, the target is automatically grappled and restrained. Until the grapple ends, the target cannot breathe and chokes (*PHB* 183).

Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to a garotte wire's choke at the discretion of the DM.

***Gauntlet-Sword.*** This specialized sword is built into a stiff gauntlet. You cannot drop or be disarmed of a gauntlet-sword. It takes an action to don or doff a gauntlet sword.

***Grapeshot.*** Instead of a single bullet, a large number of tiny projectiles fill a canister of grapeshot ammunition. Upon firing, the projectiles fly in a line 5 foot wide and as long as the gun's normal range. You can target a number of creatures in that line equal to your proficiency bonus, making new attack rolls for each creature.

***Greataxe.***  The blows of a greataxe stagger and daze opponents. You can inflict *status* with this weapon, and when you do you inflict both *status: slashing* and *status: bludgeoning,* even though you only deal slashing damage.

***Greatbow.*** An enormous bow with massive draw weight, you must use Strength instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.

***Hooksword.*** If you are holding a hooksword in each hand, checks from the weapon's *ensnaring* property are made with advantage, and the ability to link both hookswords together gives this weapon the *sweeping* property.

***Lance.*** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. A lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

***Lantern Shield.*** An apparatus combining a small shield, a lantern, a gauntlet, and several blades. When wielded it adds +2 to your Armor Class, can be used to make a melee weapon attack that deals 1d4 piercing damage, and can store a lit bullseye lantern, which you wield while holding this shield. If you are disarmed of this shield or doff it, the lantern moves with it. A lantern can be added or removed as an action.

***Morningstar.*** You can inflict *status* with this weapon, and when you do you inflict the effects of both *status: piercing* and *status: bludgeoning,*  regardless of the damage type dealt.

***Net.*** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or are Huge or larger. A creature can free itself or others by using its action and succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, and destroys the net.

***Parrying Dagger.*** Parrying daggers are best used as defensive options when wielded in conjunction with another weapon. When you hold a parrying dagger in one hand and another weapon in your other hand, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus cannot exceed 1, even if you have a parrying dagger in each hand.

***Pavise.*** A pavise is a tall, oblong shield used to provide portable cover. You can use your action to plant a pavise in the ground, doffing it as part of the same action. In this state it is no longer wielded and stands on its own to act as 1/2 cover for an upright creature, or total cover for a prone one.

***Silver Bullet.*** This bullet deals no special damage against most creatures, but any attack with a silver bullet that hits a creature with a special vulnerability to silver, like some fiends or shapechangers, is an automatic critical hit.

***Staff Sling.*** The shaft that adds leverage to the projectiles this sling throws can also be used for close-range combat. This weapon can make be wielded in melee combat as a quarterstaff. In addition, this weapon can be used to throw bombs to any point within its long range.

***Tower Shield.*** To wield a tower shield, you must have at least 15 Strength. You can use your reaction to gain three-quarters cover against harmful area-of-effects such as breath weapons or spells when targeted by such effects, unless the effect travels around corners. If you are directly between another creature of your size or smaller and the effect's origin, that creature gains half cover against the effect.

***Unarmed Strike.*** An attack with any part of your body, such as a fist or knee. Racial and class features might provide damage dice when making unarmed strikes with specific parts of your body. Unarmed strikes act as a melee weapon for features that activate after a successful weapon attack, such as martial maneuvers, divine smites, or spells delivered with weapons, but is not considered a weapon when an effect or ability such as Two-Weapon Fighting requires you to hold one.

***Whistling Arrow.*** The bulb carved from wood or antler in this arrow creates a loud whistle as it flies through the air that creatures within 300 feet of the line the arrow travels from the archer to its target can clearly hear.

### Shield Grips
Shield grips determine how you hold a shield.

**Handles** are a wood or metal handlebar on the inside of a shield. These shields can be doffed or donned with the item interaction you receive as part of your turn and can be dropped freely, but enemies have advantage on checks made to disarm you of them.

**Straps** attach the shield to the arms, reinforcing the handle with a series of cloth or leather straps. These shields take an action to don or doff, and enemies have disadvantage on checks made to disarm you of the shield.

While some shields list more than one grip type on their table entries, an individual shield of has only one. You choose the type of grip it has when it is created or purchased.

#### Shield Attacks
The exotic shields and the *Shield Master* feat allow attacks with shields. A magical shield with a bonus to AC only increases the Armor Class of the user and does not grant a bonus to attack and damage rolls with the shield. If a magical shield applies its bonus to both AC and attack and damage rolls, its rarity tier increases by one.

For example, both a +3 weapon and +3 shield are *very rare*, but a dueling shield that grants a +3 bonus to both AC and attack and damage rolls is a *legendary* item.

## Armor
The Armor Table shows the cost, weight, armor class, and properties each type of armor. 

#### Armor Proficiency. 
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however.
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

Armor you are proficient in weighs half as much while you wear it for the purposes of determining encumbrance.

#### Armor Class (AC). 
Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

#### Heavy Armor. 
Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

When worn, half plate and heavy armor offer **Damage Reduction**. When you take nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, the damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. Full plate reduces the damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus instead. This reduction applies before you apply resistances or vulnerabilities.

#### Stealth. 
If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

#### Shields. 
A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Starting Armor
You start with the armor listed for your class. If you start with a shield, you can choose any non-exotic shield.
- Artificer: Gambeson or brigandine
- Bard: Leather
- Cleric: Brigandine or leather, hauberk if proficient
- Druid: Leather
- Fighter: Leather or hauberk
- Paladin: Hauberk
- Ranger: Brigandine or leather
- Rogue: Leather

## Weapon Customization
Materials, extras, and other customizations for weapons diversify them even further. While not the numerical bonuses from masterwork items of older editions, these alterations allow you to customize your weapons further, and provide additional benefits.

### Materials
A weapon's composition is just as important as its wielder's skill. While every weapon has a default material, different substances provide circumstantial benefits. The material of a weapon cannot be changed after its creation. All the materials listed here can be used to make melee weapons, ranged weapons, armor, ammunition, and foci, though not all have an effect in each form.

> ##### Mundane and Magical
>Most smiths can only create items out of wood, iron, and steel, while specialized craftsmen can make items from bone, bronze, ironwood, obsidian, and stone. The rest are magical materials (and weapons made from them are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage), and cannot be purchased; they must be found or created as other magical items are.

[[Adamantine]]
[[Adamantinite]]
[[Bone]]
[[Bronze]]
[[Cold Iron]]
[[Flametouched Iron]]
[[Ironwood]]
[[Mithral]]
[[Obsidian]]
[[Silver Bullet]]
[[Steel]]
[[Stone]]
[[True Ice]]
[[Wood]]

### Default Materials
Most weapons are made of a combination of wood and a metal (typically iron), and very few weapons use only one. For example, crossbows and arquebuses used both wood and metal, bows use specific types of wood or horn for the arms and sinew for the string, and so on. Melee weapons, especially polearms, used a haft made of wood and a head made of iron or steel. Armor features several layers of cloth padding beneath its metal exterior. For simplicity's sake this table lists only one type of material, either the one which comprises most of the item (for ranged weapons and ammunition) or the material of the component that contacts the target (for melee weapons).

### Creating equipment
If a player chooses to create their own equipment, they can only create improvised weapons that deal up to a maximum of 1d6 damage of a type determined by the DM, unless they have access to suitable equipment and facilities and have proficiency in the appropriate tool for working with that material. A person must be proficient in the weapon they are creating or be assisted by a person who is.

When creating or modifying a piece of equipment, a character must succeed on an ability check using an appropriate ability score and their proficiency bonus if proficient in the tool.

#### Bayonet
*Modifies: light crossbow, heavy crossbow, arquebus*       
When you wield a weapon with a bayonet attached, you can wield it as a melee weapon to make an attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage with a reach of 5 feet.

#### Blunted
*Modifies: a melee weapon or 3 pieces of ammunition that deal piercing or slashing damage*             
The weapon can only deal bludgeoning damage and gains the *nonlethal* property. When you roll the highest number on a damage die, you must reroll the die and take the second roll.

#### Butt Spike
*Modifies: javelin, shortspear, glaive, greataxe, guisarme, halberd, harpoon, pike, pollaxe, ranseur, spear*           
When you come within 5 feet of a prone creature on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. This attack deals 1d6 piercing damage. None of the weapon's properties apply to that attack.

#### Consecrated
*Modifies: a weapon or three pieces of ammunition*                  
Consecrated weapons are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming the resistances and immunities to nonmagical damage of fiends and undead. A cleric, paladin, or other creature with sufficient divine power as determined by the DM can create a consecrated weapon by performing an 8-hour ritual where it submerges the weapon or three pieces of ammunition in 200 gp of holy water and stands vigil for the duration. This consumes the holy water.

#### Decorated
*Modifies: armor*        
The set of armor is decorated with paint, etching, precious metals, or gemstones. It confers no benefits on the battlefield, but may sometimes grant advantage on Persuasion checks while you wear it by creating an aura of wealth and prestige.

#### Enhanced Guard
*Modifies: dagger, mace, arming sword, bastard sword, battlaxe, estoc, greatsword, longsword, morningstar, parrying dagger, rapier, rondel, shortsword*            
A sword with this guard, often a basket hilt, grants you advantage on checks to avoid being disarmed of it.

#### Fire Lance
*Modifies: goedendag, glaive, guisarme, lance, lucerne, pike, ranseur, spear*             
A explosive barrel packed with gunpowder and pellets attached to the end of a polearm. When you would attack with the weapon equipped with it, you can instead fire the lance, forcing each creature in a line 10 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

If installed on a weapon with the *reach* property, the line's point of origin can be any point within 10 feet of you, rather than extending directly from you.

#### Flaming
*Modifies: all melee weapons, three pieces of ammunition that are not bullets*            
For 1 minute, half the damage you deal with this weapon or piece of ammunition is fire damage. You can use an action to spread and light oil on 3 pieces of ammunition or a melee weapon, which sets them alight. Firing a piece of flaming ammunition more than half its weapon's normal range extinguishes it, which removes this modification. Items with this modification shed bright light in a 5 ft. radius, and dim light for another 5.

#### Furred
*Modifies: armor*        
Armor lined or reinforced with animal hides and furs for warmth. When wearing furred armor, you make saving throws against extremely cold environments and weather with advantage, and against hot environments at disadvantage. Adding fur increases armor's weight by 5 pounds. Hide Armor is always furred.

#### Guige
*Modifies: buckler, shield, tower shield, dueling shield*            
When you drop or are disarmed of a shield with a guige, it remains on your person instead of falling to the ground. It provides no bonus to armor class and you are not wielding it. 	

#### Guisarme Hook
*Modifies: glaive, pike*            
A hook added to the back of the head which adds the *ensnaring* property to the weapon.

#### Jagged
*Modifies: any melee weapon*     
A broken weapon can still be of some use. You cannot add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon, but it gains the *status: slashing* property until repaired.

#### Penobscot Arms
*Modifies: shortbow, greatbow, longbow, recurve bow*            
When you roll a 1 on a weapon damage die for an attack you make with a bow that has this set of forward-facing secondary arms, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll, even if the new roll is also a 1.

#### Poison Reservoir
*Modifies: a melee weapon or three pieces of ammunition that deal piercing or slashing damage*            
A weapon with this modification stores up to 5 doses of one type of injury poison at one time. When you deal piercing or slashing damage to a creature, you can choose to deliver the poison. Poison in the reservoir never dries.

#### Repeater
*Modifies: light crossbow, hand crossbow, heavy crossbow*            
This device attached to a crossbow allows you to fire it 5 times before reloading. You can load 5 pieces of ammunition instead of 1 when you load this weapon.

#### Scope
*Modifies: light crossbow, shortbow, greatbow, heavy crossbow, longbow, recurve bow, arquebus*            
A weapon with a scope attached doesn't have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond its standard range.

#### Second Barrel
*Modifies: arquebus, handgonne*            
This additional barrel multiplies the weight of the gun by 1.5 and allows you to attack twice, instead of once, before reloading. You can load both barrels with a single action.

#### Serrated
*Modifies: a melee weapon or three pieces of ammunition that deal piercing or slashing damage*           
When you land a critical hit or exceed a target's AC by 5 or more and deal piercing or slashing damage, you deal additional necrotic damage equal to half your proficiency bonus. Objects, Constructs, and Elementals and other creatures that do not bleed may be immune to this damage,  at the discretion of your DM.

#### Spiked
*Modifies: club, greatclub, cestus*        
When you land a critical hit or exceed a target's AC by 5 or more, you deal  additional piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

## Alternative Weapons
Many weapons can be represented by the same mechanics. Examples are listed on the table below. Weapons use the same statistics, though their damage types may differ. That change is listed in parentheses: (b) for bludgeoning, (p) for piercing, and (s) for slashing. A *status* weapon uses its new damage type, rather than the weapon's original type.

Since most alternates originate from cultures and eras outside D&D's early-renaissance European pastiche—such as Rome, Japan, China, India, and Polynesia—they are not appropriate for every game and location. The DM is within their rights to disallow any alternative on this list.
