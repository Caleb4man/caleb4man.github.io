***Silver.*** Some monsters with immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. The cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. It costs 100 gp to silver a weapon or 10 pieces of ammunition. Unlike most materials, a weapon that is silvered retains all the properties of its original material.
