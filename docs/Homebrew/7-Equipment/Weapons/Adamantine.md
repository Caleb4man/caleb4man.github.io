***Adamantine.*** An ultra-hard jet-black metal with a multicolored sheen, weapons made from this meteoric iron devastate other objects. When you hit an object with an adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition, the hit is a critical hit. All adamantine melee weapons have the *sundering* property, against all types of wearable armor. If a creature attempts to parry an attack you made with an adamantine melee weapon and your attack hits in spite of the attempt, both the target and the parrying weapon or shield take damage from the attack. When wearing adamantine armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. An adamantine item costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the item is made of the metal or coated with it.
