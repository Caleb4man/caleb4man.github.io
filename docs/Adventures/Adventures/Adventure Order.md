## Beginning
Notes for the players: You have one day worth of rations for this adventure.

> You approach the camp slowly. The bandits at this camp have been terrorizing this area long enough. Your group spreads out as you approach the campsite. A woman, dressed in the robes of the traveling bandits, sits by the fire in the center of the camp. Few soldiers are nearby. You seem to have caught the camp by surprise. 
> Just to your right, you hear the whizzing of an arrow. You look to your right, and a bandit falls down next to you, an arrow lodged in his heart. You look behind you, and Private Buskins gives you a wink as he nocks the next arrow into his bow.

Then, the party can roll initiative. As they grow closer to the center of the camp, the woman stands up.

> The woman in the center of the camp stands and reaches into her bag. She pulls out a fistful of powder and dumps it into the fire. A cold breeze wafts through the camp.  Around the camp, a ring of mist folds in around you. 
> The mists close in on you. 

The party must pass a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to avoid getting knocked out by the mists. If they succeed, they see the world warp before their eyes and they reappear in a new field of green grass and wildflowers, where they must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. 
When they fail their saving throw, they wake up in a field of flowers at the top of a hill after some time. They recieve the benefits of a long rest if they eat a meal at this point.

> The sun shines brightly above you. You can feel the sunlight burning brightly on your skin. This hill you stand upon has a field of brown grass and orange flowers. Just down the hill, you see a road that leads uphill into a small town, surrounded by a palisade wall. At the far end of the town at the top of the hill, you see a large stone keep.
> At the bottom of this hill, at the end of the road, you see a pile of refuse.
> Your stomachs grumble. You have been unconsious for some time. If you eat now, you gain the benefits of a long rest, but your remaining food will be gone.

## Prieten Cerb
> Near the pile of refuse, you see a centaur with its front two legs supported by wheels. 
> "Welcome to Barrio Sesamo," he says as you approach. "The finest nightmare in all the world. Do you have any food to spare?"

If the party gives him food, they learn that he does not much like the taste of whatever they fed him. He pulls out some sort of seasoning from the trash pile, adds it to the food, and seems to enjoy it more.
> "Want some?"


If the PCs accept, they find this repulsive and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution save to not be poisoned for 1 minute.

> "I'm Prieten Cerb," he continues, between bites of the food. "I'm the town greeter. But the town stinks. Look at how steep it is." He gestures to the town's approximately 30 degree angle.
> He begins his speech. "Hello, and welcome to Barrio Sesamo, the world's friendliest town. It's also the future location of a desert. We have a grocer and a library, and only one of those is currently operating."
> He pulls out a large stick. "Hold that thought," he says, and walks a little bit away from you. He lifts the stick above his head, lying in wait, and then suddenly swings down, striking something in the rubble.
> "Got it," he says, and he holds up a small creature about the size of a softball, with four small eyestalks coming off the top. "If you see any of these, take them out. They've been bothering the town for a time now, and they seem to be collecting information on us for some reason."

Most other questions that Prieten Cerb can answer are answered with explatives and a relentlessly negative attitude.

## The Grocer
There are two gazers outside the grocer. They flee when they are in danger, but do not realize they are in danger until it is too late.

The local grocer, named "Alan's place" is abandoned except for a shopkeeper. There is no food on any of the shelves except a few canned goods. These are sold for 1gp per item.
> A sword sits behind the counter, near a black human. He is carving idly into a piece of wood. As you enter, he grabs his sword. When he sees you, he relaxes some, but keeps his sword close.
> "Newcomers?" he says, smiling at you. "Welcome, friends. If you're looking for food, unfortunately we've nearly run out. The drought has very nearly destroyed our food stores. I'm Alan Hooper, and those pickled beets are all we have left. Though some people in town have been saying that they'd rather die than eat them."
> "This drought has been just ruining this town. We used to have a nice little haven here. Everyone knew each other. We had plenty of food. We had an eating competition, actually, for a while, but that has been out of commission for a while."
> "Actually, if you want to help, talk to Pasare Mare. He's the sheriff around here. He might know something. But I'll warn you, a lot of the people around here have lost their minds."

There are two Gazers that can be found in the grocer. They flee when they are in danger, but do not realize they are in danger until it is too late.

## The Library
The local library is managed by a librarian named Linda. She is deaf and cannot communicate with the party. Asking around the Library locates Paul Benedict, who Is maddeningly painting giant red numbers on the wall. 

> "There's not enough numbers! We need more numbers! The numbers will bring back the rain!" 

There are two Gazers that can be found in the Library. They flee when they are in danger, but do not realize they are in danger until it is too late.

## The Sheriff's Office
Pasare Mare, the Sheriff, is holed up in his home above the sheriff's office. As the party approaches, he ushers them inside. 
> A long, colorfully beaked face like a toucan peers out from the shadows inside. A hand appears and gestures for you to come in. 
> "I am Pasare Mare," He says as he lights a lantern, "the sheriff of this town. You've come at a bad time." 
> "Ever Since Conte Numara has been locked in his keep, we have not gotten rain. We were okay for a little while, as we had food stored, but now we are at the end of our rope. There is nearly no food in the town, and that which is, is in the keep. A million lives are in the balance now."
> "Under normal circumstances, I would just pay him a visit to see what is wrong, but some creatures have taken up residence in his home. It appears this is causing some sort of disturbance for him. Every time I approach, they become hostile and attack. They did this to me last time I was there." He shows you a broken wing.
> "It's normal for the Conte to be a bit crazy. He has a bit of a bizarre obsession with getting things in order. It seems that his madness is seeping out to the rest of the town. If you can get in there and allow him to escape, that would be greatly appreciated."

The Broken Wing requires a *Regenerate* spell to heal.
If the players ask what happened:
> "These creatures are small and have doglike snouts. I'm sorry I don't have a better description. They have flung high-speed stones at me, poured boiling oil toward me, and even shot flaming arrows at me and the town."

If the players ask why he can't leave the town:
> A sudden clamor sounds at the door. "FOOD! ANY FOOD! I DON"T EVEN CARE WHAT IT IS, I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME IN THERE!"
> "That's why. I'm afraid I have to put this monster back in his home. We would be grateful if you could help us with this situation." He draws a short sword and begins to leave. "Alright, Sid, are we going to have to do this the easy way or the hard way?"

## 123 Brownstone Building
> Bars cover this building's doors and windows. You are waved away by a man sitting at a desk inside. He does not answer your calls.
