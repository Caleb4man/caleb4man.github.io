I just ran a dungeon with Tucker's Kobolds for a level 7 party. They had been causing trouble for local towns and holed up in an abandoned dwarven fortress. They loaded the place full of traps and got into a direct confrontation twice, the second being their demise.

## Approaching the Keep
> As you begin to approach the keep, you see a small, long-nosed creature poke its head out of an upper window. A small cry escapes from its mouth as it shuts a door, matching the rest of the wooden portion of the ramparts.

If they continue to approach:
> As you continue to approach, you see a row of doors like you had seen before and a volley of burning arrows fly out toward you.

The kobolds attack with disadvantage and a +4 to hit.

If they speed up:
> As you approach the entrance to the castle, you see a door open up just above you and a huge amount of liquid fall down around you. 

Players must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. 


## Entrance
> There are small square holes on the left and right sides of this entryway. The walls here seem to be shoddily put together from wood. The ground is sticky and is covered with a strong-smelling liquid. It is dark in here.

As the players approach:
> Suddenly, a hand reaches out of one of the holes, tossing a torch on the ground. The room is suddenly aflame. The fire is creeping toward you. Roll initiative.

If the players rush forward:
> You are running along and you feel the floor give out from under you. You are now in a pit trap full of liquid You struggle to swim and stay afloat in this thick oil. It will take an action to free yourself from the trap, and this area is difficult terrain, and you must swim in this area.

If they have a torch out:
> Your torch falls into the liquid, igniting it. You can stay below the surface of the liquid, where it is cool, but you cannot breathe there. Alternatively, you can try to leave, risking the fire.

The fire deals 5 fire damage.

## The Barracks
> This room is clean, largely unsoiled. There is a few beds and a footlocker at the foot of each of them.
> In one corner, there is a pipe just over a pile of junk on the ground.
> As you filter into this area, you hear the slam of some object into the door behind you. You are trapped! Above you, a winged version of one of these creatures flies into the room and spins a valve. The pipe begins spewing water into the room.

Removing the pile of junk or breaking down a door or killing the winged Kobold before it opens the valve will prevent the room from being flooded.

## Junk room
> This room is thick with junk. Fine clothes have been shredded and left on the ground. Is that a skull? This appears to be the Kobolds' junk room. Above the junk, there are many cobwebs in this room. 

A perception check of 10 reveals that there are bear traps in this room.

## Throne Room
> This room is open to the sky. There is a throne located in the center of the room, and two winged kobolds in the center. When they see you, they pull themselves up into the air and draw their bows. Roll initiative.

The throne itself has a poisoned needle (Con save dc 10 or 1d6 poison damage, half on save) if anyone chooses to sit on it.

## Checkers Room
> This room has a checkerboard floor. Several piles of bones sit here. As you enter, the piles of bones pull themselves together to form full skeletons of small giants. 
> Does anyone have a 14 passive perception or higher?
> The red tiles have tiny holes in them. It's too dark to see what is happening with those holes, though.
> Does anyone have a 16 passive perception or higher?
> Above you, there are some sort of wooden scaffolding that covers most of the ceiling, but it has some tracks in a grid around the room. You faintly hear laughter.

A room with checkerboard floors, and piles of bones. As the party enters the bones "animate". The skeletons are not actually animated, but puppeted by kobolds in the ceiling. Every 20 initiative count, one of the two colors becomes covered in spikes (1d4 piercing damage) from the floor causing the party to dance around the colored tiles while fighting "skeletons". The bones can take significant damage before breaking, they "attack" but miss every attack.

## Home room
> This room is full of beds. It isn't thick, but it all surrounds a creature with a giant eye and several eyestalks, like the gazers you have seen around town, but much larger. 
> "You are not welcome here," it says into your mind. It is flanked by two gazers. Roll initiative.
> ***Passive Perception DC 13***: You hear sobbing coming from the next room. 


## Interrogations
If the players interrogate one or more of the enemies, they tell the players that the great mage "The Amazing Mumford!" told them they could stay there, as long as they made their home in that room.

## The Conte
The conte immediately counts anything that he can, summoning a cloud, then rain, then thunder and lightning.
> "I am afraid I was counting at midnight and he wished to have some sleep, and so he indived these creatures to make their home in my home. Unfortunately, a vampire cannot enter their dwelling without permission, so I have been stuck here for quite some time."
> "Have I told you what my favorite number is? It is 34,969."
